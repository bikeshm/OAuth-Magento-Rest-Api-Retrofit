# OAuthMagentoRestApi
In official Magento documentation, one plain PHP class is written on OAuth authentication and Consume Magento REST web service. But it was very difficult to find an example to do the OAuth authentication for Android. We created this sample based on Android Platform that connects to Magento REST API and authenticate/authorise the customer to access the product lists.

In this sample app, we have used <a href="http://square.github.io/retrofit/">Retrofit</a>, <a href="http://simple.sourceforge.net/home.php">Simple XML</a>, <a href="http://square.github.io/okhttp/">OkHttp</a> and <a href="https://github.com/google/google-api-java-client">Google API Client</a> to provide a platform for developer which can be used for developing android mobile application for magento framework.
